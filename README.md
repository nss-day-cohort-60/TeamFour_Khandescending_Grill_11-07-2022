# Khandescending Grill

The owners of Khandescending Grill have asked you to build a Web based UI that allows customers to pick which foods they want in their bowl and place an order.

## User Stories

Diners at the Khandescending grill should be able to pick one each of a protein, a vegetable, a carb, a sauce, a seasoning, and a bowl size.

There should also be a Create Order button, When the user clicks the button, their order number and price total should be printed below the button.

## Layout

At the top of the browser window, the user should see a list of choices (protein, vegetable, carb, sauce, seasoning, bowl size), with one column for each.

Below that show the button and the previous orders.
